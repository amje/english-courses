## French borrowings
After the Norman Conquest of 1066, Anglo-Norman (old French) became the language of the elite in the UK.

For 300 years, Norman was the language the British elite used to distinguish itself from the population.

Back then, French was a clear way to say “I’m not like most people”.

That’s why you can find a huge amount of French words when you talk about luxury, food or boring things like the law.
