## French borrowings
After the Norman Conquest of 1066, Anglo-Norman (old French) became the language of the elite in the UK.

For 300 years, Norman was the language the British elite used to distinguish itself from the population.

Back then, French was a clear way to say “I’m not like most people”.

That’s why you can find a huge amount of French words when you talk about luxury, food or boring things like the law.

1. Bloc.Party company has developed a new way to play board games using blockchain technology: the PlayTable, hybrid of video games console and table-sized tablet.
2. It's designed to enhance the experience of playing table games.
3. The PlayTable is able to read information from physical game pieces or cards, and then store that information securely online, so every move you make is saved and recorded.
4. PlayTable can read anything with radio-frequency identification sticker, so it's possible to 3D print a piece, slap a sticker on it and use it in a game. And because information is stored in the blockchain, you can use it anywhere - at a competitive event or a friend's house.
5. It also removes the need to keep track of rules for complex board games. Smartphones can be linked to the PlayTable to display, for instance, private poker hands.
