# Answers
## Product presentation
### Plan
1. the challenge of true mobility
    * many mobile devices
    * wireless power is the last thing of true mobility
2. technology overview
    * useful power over long distance
    * infrared beams of light
    * transmitter: delivers power in its area, emits focused, safe infrared beams that carry power to receiver
    * receiver: captures light from transmitter, convert it to electrical power using photovoltaic cell, just like solar panels
3. transmitter
    * very smart device, automatic identification
    * multiple clients, power-management algorithm
4. receiver
    * small size
    * contains photovoltaic cell, miniature optic and electronic hardware
    * may also be supplied with micro-USB or Lightning output connectors
5. power delivery
    * automatic client identification
6. line of sight
    * power flows in a straight, narrow line
    * steady power delivery, energy storage buffer
7. communication
    * transmitter and receiver share communication channel
    * data payload is application dependent and customizable
    * channel can enable identification of device properties, efficient power flow
8. product features
    * automatic - the transmitter finds the devices and powers them without intervention
    * safe - complies with international standards and regulations
    * power delivery over distance
    * wide field of view - single transmitter can cover a room of 250 square feet
    * high power
    * power is constant over distance - no power dissipation and 100% link efficiency
    * multiple devices can be charged simultaneously
    * scalable - additional transmitters can be placed to increase coverage, power and number of receivers
    * smart power delivery according receiving-device parameters
