### Summary
**Snake surprises a driver**  
The driver was running a delivery for his employer when suddenly the snake slithered out from the bonnet. From there, the venomous reptile wrapped itself around the driver's side mirror. It was sort of tapping on the window couple times trying to get into the car. The driver called his co-worker, who came equipped with a broom to remove the snake. Eventually they got it off the car nice and safely. The driver thought the snake had entered the engine bay seeking heat place, because last night was cold and the snake got up into the engine bay to keep itself warm. Then, later in the morning while the vehicle was running the snake has got too hot there, so it wanted out.
