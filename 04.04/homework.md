## Plan
1. Variety of Elvish languages.
    * Elder Speech in The Witcher saga
    * Elvish languages of the Warcraft universe
    * The language of the Dalish elves in the Dragon Age series of videogames
    * ... and from films
    * The elves in the film Hellboy II: The Golden Army speak a language based on Scottish Gaelic [ˈkaːlikʲ]
    * Shiväisith - language of the Dark Elves in Thor: The Dark World constructed by David J. Peterson
2. Many Elvish languages by J. R. R. Tolkien. Family of several related languages and dialects.
    * Primitive Quendian, or Quenderin
        * Avarin
        * Common Eldarin
            * Quenya
            * Common Telerin
                * Telerin
                * Nandorin
                * Sindarin
3. Sindarin is most widely spoken elvish language in Lord of The Rings plot. This language will be used for examples.
4. Pronunciation
    * Six vowers (a, e, i, o, u, y); Three forms show sound's length of a vowel. (a - blank, shortest; á - accute accent, longer; â - circumflex accent, longest)
    * Consonants are the same as in English, with some differences:
        * The letter c always denotes [k] (i. e. Celeborn is pronounced Keleborn).
        * The letter g always denotes the hard [ɡ], as in give, rather than the soft form, as in gem.
        * The digraph dh, as in Caradhras, denotes [ð] as in English this.
        * The digraph ch, as in Orch, denotes [x] as in German ach, and never like the ch [*t͡ʃ] in English chair.
